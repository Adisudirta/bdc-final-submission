          Trash Cash is a platform that enables users to easily sell their trash
          to interested buyers. It connects sellers with potential buyers,
          allowing them to list and negotiate prices for recyclable materials,
          reusable items, and other types of waste. By promoting recycling and
          reducing waste, Trash Cash fosters environmental responsibility while
          providing a platform for individuals to generate income from their
          discarded items.
